# AWS Robomaker Quickstart

This quickstart guide repo prepares a demo to give you a taste on how to develop robot application and simulation on AWS Robomaker.

In this demo, a turtlebot will move forward, once it detects a wall, it will change direction and move backward. Then if it detects a wall in its back, it will switch to moving forward again.

Reference: This quickstart is developed using the [aws-robomaker-sample-application-helloworld repo](https://github.com/aws-robotics/aws-robomaker-sample-application-helloworld.git)
